How to customize the Instana experience

# Quick Setup
If you already completed the first part but deleted the environment and need to start from scratch there is a script which will do all the prepwork for you in an instant.
Simply excute the following command in the directory you are in :-)
```
./fastforward.sh
```
And you are done. This script will copy all the changes from the basic setup to the instanafied version in one go.
Now simply go up one level and run the
```
docker-compose up -d
```
command.

## Preparing the services
You will see all the services as they are coming to life in Instana.
